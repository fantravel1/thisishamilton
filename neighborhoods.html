          <p>Hamilton is not one place. It is dozens of places that happen to share a city boundary. The Niagara Escarpment &mdash; a 100-metre limestone cliff face that is part of a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve &mdash; physically splits the city into "the mountain" above and "the lower city" below, creating two distinct worlds connected by winding access roads and over 100 sets of public staircases.</p>
          <p>Below the escarpment, the downtown core hums with arts culture and immigrant food traditions. Above it, the mountain stretches out into suburban communities with sweeping views of Lake Ontario. And beyond both, former towns like Dundas, Ancaster, and Stoney Creek carry their own histories, their own main streets, and their own fierce local pride.</p>

          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">No other Canadian city has a geography quite like Hamilton's. The Niagara Escarpment &mdash; a 100-metre cliff face that stretches from Niagara to Tobermory &mdash; runs directly through the middle of the city, splitting it into two distinct halves. Hamiltonians refer to them simply as "the mountain" and "the lower city," and the distinction shapes everything: the views, the weather, the culture, even the traffic.</p>
          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">The lower city sits between the escarpment and the harbour, home to the downtown core, the steel mills, the arts scene on James North, and the immigrant food streets. It's denser, older, and grittier. The mountain rises above, a plateau of post-war suburbs, strip plazas, and panoramic lookout points where you can see all the way to Toronto on a clear day.</p>
          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">Connecting the two are the mountain accesses &mdash; winding roads carved into the escarpment face &mdash; and the famous Wentworth Steps, Hamilton's beloved public staircases that have become a symbol of the city's toughness and its embrace of the vertical landscape.</p>
