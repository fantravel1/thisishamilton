          <h2 id="intro-title" class="section-title">Grown From the Ground Up.<br>Not Imported.</h2>
          <p>Hamilton's creative culture was never handed down from a government initiative or imported from a bigger city. It was built by artists who found cheap rent, empty warehouses, and a community that let them take risks. James Street North &mdash; now the city's gallery district &mdash; was once lined with boarded-up storefronts. Artists moved in because nobody else would.</p>
          <p>That DIY spirit still runs through everything. Art Crawl, the monthly gallery walk that draws thousands to James North every second Friday, started as a handful of studios opening their doors. The Cotton Factory, a sprawling creative hub in a former industrial mill, houses dozens of artists, makers, and small businesses under one roof. Supercrawl, the annual street festival, grew from a single block party into a weekend event drawing over 200,000 people.</p>
          <p>Hamilton's arts scene isn't polished. It's real. And that's exactly why it works.</p>

It anchors the city's cultural identity and has been a cornerstone institution since 1914.</p>
          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">But the real energy lives on the streets. James Street North is lined with independent galleries &mdash; artist-run spaces showing emerging work, commercial galleries representing local talent, and pop-up exhibitions in storefronts that double as studios. You Don't Need to Knock, Centre[3] for Artistic + Social Practice, and Hamilton Artists Inc. are just a few of the spaces that have made Hamilton a destination for contemporary art in Ontario.</p>
          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">Together, the institutional and the independent create a gallery scene that punches far above the city's weight &mdash; accessible, affordable, and unapologetically local.</p>
