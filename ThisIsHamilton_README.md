- lived Hamilton  
- working Hamilton  
- creative Hamilton

## 🎯 Core Positioning

ThisIsHamilton is:

- not tourism-first  
- not visitor-optimized fluff  
- not “Toronto’s little sibling”  

It is:
> **a city speaking for itself.**

Hamilton is presented as:
- proud, but not defensive  
- gritty, but not stuck  
- soft, but not naïve  
- changing, but not erased  

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

The secret sauce is simple:

> **Locals first. Visitors second.**

If locals say:
> *“Yeah… that’s actually us.”*

Visitors will trust it instantly.
