          <p>In Hamilton, food is autobiography. Every street tells a different story through what it serves. Portuguese bakeries line Dundurn Street, their windows fogged with the heat of crusty bread pulled from stone ovens before dawn. Italian delis on James Street have been slicing prosciutto and rolling fresh pasta since the 1950s. Caribbean kitchens on Barton Street serve jerk chicken and roti that taste like home for the families who built this city's east end.</p>
          <p>Walk ten minutes in any direction and the flavours change completely. Vietnamese pho houses sit beside Syrian shawarma shops. A Salvadoran pupuseria shares a block with a Polish deli. This isn't curated diversity &mdash; it's real life, built over decades of families putting down roots and keeping their traditions alive.</p>

          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">Hamilton's new food scene didn't erase the old one. It built on top of it. On King William Street, farm-to-table restaurants source from local growers in Flamborough and the escarpment bench. On Augusta Street, craft cocktail bars pour inventive drinks in repurposed industrial spaces. Along James North, chefs who trained in Toronto and Montreal chose Hamilton &mdash; for the space, the affordability, and the freedom to cook without pretension.</p>
          <p style="color: rgba(245,240,232,0.8);">What makes Hamilton's new wave different is respect. The best new restaurants don't ignore what came before &mdash; they honour it. A modern bistro on King William might source its bread from a Portuguese bakery that's been open since 1972. A cocktail bar on James might pair its drinks with Italian charcuterie from a deli three doors down. The old and the new aren't in competition. They're in conversation.</p>
