            <p class="waterfall-card__desc">A beloved hidden gem tucked away in Ancaster's forests. This 17-metre cascade feels like a secret, surrounded by old-growth Carolinian forest and dramatic limestone walls that create a natural amphitheatre. The short trail to the falls follows Ancaster Creek through a quiet, moss-covered ravine. Less crowded than the Spencer Gorge falls, Sherman is a local favourite for those seeking a peaceful waterfall experience.</p>

          <p class="feature-card__desc" style="color: var(--color-text-light);">Every season reveals a different side of Hamilton's waterfalls. <strong>Spring</strong> brings powerful flows from snowmelt &mdash; the falls are at their loudest and most dramatic. <strong>Fall</strong> frames the cascades in brilliant reds, oranges, and golds. <strong>Winter</strong> transforms many falls into stunning ice sculptures. <strong>Summer</strong> offers lush green surroundings but draws the biggest crowds &mdash; visit early morning on weekdays for the best experience.</p>

          <p class="feature-card__desc" style="color: var(--color-text-light);">Always stay on marked trails and behind safety barriers &mdash; escarpment edges can be unstable and slippery. Wear proper footwear with good grip, especially in wet conditions. Some falls like Webster's and Tew's require a <strong>timed reservation</strong> during peak season through the Hamilton Conservation Authority. Trails may be closed seasonally for safety or ecological restoration. Check conditions before you go.</p>

          <p class="feature-card__desc" style="color: var(--color-text-light);">Many Hamilton waterfalls are accessible by <strong>HSR bus</strong>, including Albion Falls, Devil's Punchbowl, and Chedoke Falls. Conservation area falls like Webster's and Tew's are best reached by car, with paid parking at Spencer Gorge. For a car-free adventure, the <strong>Bruce Trail</strong> connects several waterfalls on foot. Hamilton is also accessible from Toronto via <strong>GO Transit</strong> in under an hour.</p>
